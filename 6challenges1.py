##Write a program that takes the ages of two people as input from the user. Compare their
##ages using comparison operators (==, !=, >, <, >=, <=) and print messages indicating the
##results (e.g., "Person 1 is older than Person 2").


age_first = int(input("Enter age of first person:"))
age_second = int(input("Enter age of second person:"))

if age_first >= age_second :
    
     print (f"Person 1 is older than Person 2")
else :
    print(f"Person 2 is greater than Person 1")
